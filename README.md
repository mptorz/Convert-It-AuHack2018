## Description

We all know the struggles during the first days/weeks in a foreign country when we are trying to figure out if we are about to make a good deal or being ripped off. With Convert it we are presenting a simple and easy to use augmented reality app to convert price tags just by pointing your camera on it, into any currency which makes sense to you. The app was built in android studio, using Google's mobile vision for image recognition and an open exchange rates api to convert currencies. The app was created in 48 hours in a team during the AuHack 2018 Hackathon.
